## Separators
- Symbol `,` is separator of notes, example: `0,1,2,3`, 0 = left note, 1 = down note, 2 = up note, 3 = right note
- Symbol `/` is separator of random, example: `0/1,2/3`, 0 or 1 = left note, 2 or 3 = down note
- New line is separator of key count, example: 1 line is 1 key
## Creating a 10 key (for example)
1. Add new line in **ALL** [1-9]key.txt, for example it will be for `1key.txt`:
- 9 line (9 key): `0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8,9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17`
- 10 line (10 key): `0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9,10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19`
2. Create new file `10key.txt` and create algorithm for 10 key (check separators)!
